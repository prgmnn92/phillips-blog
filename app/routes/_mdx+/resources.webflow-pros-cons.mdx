# **Want to use Webflow for your next project? Here's what you need to know**

Webflow ‚Äì maybe you've heard of it, maybe not, but let me tell you: It could be the best tool out there for creating stunning websites. üòä With Webflow, you can build everything from static websites to blogs and e-commerce sites. Granted, it's not exactly easy to learn, but once you get the hang of it, you'll find there's hardly a more efficient way to craft websites with a truly individual design.

I've been working with Webflow for over four years now and have seen quite a bit in that time. I'd like to share some insights into the pros and cons of Webflow. In the end, I'll give you my personal take on what Webflow is best suited for ‚Äì and what it might not be as good for.

## **Advantages**

### **Development Speed**

One of the biggest advantages of Webflow? Definitely: The lightning speed at which you can bring your website to life! üöÄ Even beginners can see quick results. Thanks to the intuitive drag-and-drop system, adding elements and tailoring them in the designer to your needs is a breeze. And once you master a few keyboard shortcuts and navigation tricks, everything becomes even faster. Plus, the option to use pre-made components in your project ‚Äì if you set some up, you can significantly boost your development pace. Personally, I can now finish entire landing pages in just a few hours. Of course, the time required always depends on the complexity of the landing page, but for a basic one without fancy features, I usually need less than 5 hours.

### **User-Friendliness**

Once you've gotten a bit familiar with the Webflow designer or editor, you'll see how easy it is to make small changes yourself, even without any prior knowledge. Whether it's swapping images or updating texts ‚Äì it's child's play! üòÑ This is especially handy for my clients, as they don't need to hit me up for every little tweak. A real win-win, I'd say!

### **Custom Code**

What often challenged me on other platforms was embedding my own code. Webflow makes this a piece of cake. Thanks to the "Embed" element, you can effortlessly incorporate your own HTML, JavaScript, or CSS code. This is a real game-changer when it comes to implementing trickier CSS rules or creating specific interactions that aren't possible with standard Webflow animations. So, I can simply conjure up my own code, and voil√† ‚Äì from a frontend developer's perspective, there are virtually no limits. üöÄ

### **Community and Tools**

The Webflow community has seen real growth in the last few years. New tools and integrations that fill previously existing gaps ‚Äì like user management or implementing payment methods like Stripe ‚Äì keep popping up. The good news: Almost always, a solution to a Webflow problem can be found with a quick Google search, and if not, the Webflow forum is there for you. There's a huge array of tools, components, and browser extensions from heavyweights like "Finsweet" and "Relume," who lead in the community. I like to use these resources myself; they make my work more efficient and speed up results. üõ†Ô∏è Plus, with their "Style Guide," they've essentially set a standard for developing Webflow websites. Following this guide makes it easy for other developers to take over projects ‚Äì which greatly simplifies maintenance and further development.

### **Website Performance**

Webflow websites can achieve impressive performance scores. It's important to know how to "properly" set up a Webflow website ‚Äì and that's not too difficult if you follow a few basic rules.

Basically, Webflow websites are delivered statically. This means the website is fully built before it's sent to the user. The content isn't generated at the user's end or on request, as is often the case with dynamic web applications. This leads to content being quickly available to the user.

Additionally, there are a few "tricks" or rules to follow to achieve optimal performance results. These include compressing images, adjusting image sizes to their actual display size, or preferring CSS animations over compute-intensive JavaScript animations. By taking these steps, you can significantly boost the performance of your Webflow site.

## **Disadvantages**

### **Limited CMS System**

When building more complex websites, Webflow's CMS system can sometimes be a limiting factor. For standard subscriptions, Webflow currently has a limit of 2,000 CMS items. There are also limitations on the number of references and fields within a CMS, a limit on "nesting" within a CMS item, and a maximum number of CMS lists that can be placed on a page. For most projects ‚Äì think a "standard" blog or a simple landing page ‚Äì this limit shouldn't pose a problem.

There are third-party solutions, such as using Airtable as a CMS. Personally, I don't find it ideal to rely on external software to run a Webflow site, as this can negatively impact performance depending on how many third-party solutions you end up needing to get the website "running."

But when it comes to creating complex marketing pages with various funnels, dynamic landing page layouts, or generally "more complex" structures, Webflow might reach its limits. Here, you'll have to weigh whether the compromises are worth it for higher adaptability but potentially lower development speed.

Thanks to my years of experience with Webflow, I know exactly what the platform is suited for and when not. So, if you're unsure whether Webflow's limitations might become a problem for you, feel free to [contact](mailto:pargmann92@gmail.com?subject=Hello) me.

### **No Backend**

One of the drawbacks of Webflow is the lack of accessible backend logic. I've often been asked about implementing features like a download counter for eBooks or comment sections. It's not impossible to implement such features in Webflow ‚Äì for example, by using Zapier and form submissions ‚Äì but for me, these are more like workarounds I'd rather not use unless necessary. Moreover, these special use cases can become costly. For instance, Zapier charges for a certain number of interactions, and if exceeded, you pay an additional amount per interaction... which can significantly increase costs depending on the project's scope and frequency of use.

### **Cost Factor**

Compared to other platforms, Webflow can indeed be pricey. There are costs for workspaces, which only apply if you work in a team or as a freelancer, and there's the monthly fee for a website. Depending on the features you need for your website and whether you choose to pay monthly or annually, costs can range from $14 to $49 per month. This investment should be carefully considered, especially if you plan to manage multiple projects simultaneously or rely on specific features.

### **Not Ideal for Web Applications**

While there are third-party solutions available today that allow for the creation of entire web applications with Webflow, I view this option as viable only for quick prototyping. The scalability and extensibility of such solutions are often limited. If you aim to develop a product intended for a long lifespan and flexible expansion, I advise having the application traditionally programmed. For sustainable and growth-oriented projects, traditional development approaches are generally a better choice compared to a no-code solution.

### **Conclusion**

If you need a manageable, quickly deployable website primarily for marketing purposes, Webflow is hard to beat. The platform excels with its user-friendliness, the ability to rapidly create appealing pages, and solid performance. However, as your project increases in complexity or if you're considering a specialized web application, Webflow might reach its limits. In such cases, it may be wiser to invest in custom programming. Switching from Webflow to a fully programmed solution too late can not only affect timing but also prove to be financially disadvantageous. In short: Webflow is a powerful tool for certain projects, but it's important to understand its limitations and plan ahead to avoid potential setbacks.
